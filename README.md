# Chaotic Advection and Blinking Vortices
This is a repository containing a Jupiter notebook for the modelling of chaotic advection and blinking vortices in a fluid. In it, three major parts allow for the investigation of a chaotic fluid system:
1. Use of SciPy to integrate particle trajectories
2. Conisderation of numerical accuracy
3. Calculation of a finit etime Lyupanov exponent
